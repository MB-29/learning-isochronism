# Deep learning dynamics from physical principles

Let $T > 0$. Which potential energy functions $U$ yield $T$-isochronism for the one-dimensional physical system $\ddot{x} =-U'(x)$ ?

Under mild assumptions, one can check that the only symmetric potentials satisfying this property are harmonic : $U(x) = x^2$.


We propose to recover this result experimentally by training a neural differential equation to satisfy global $T-periodicity$.
